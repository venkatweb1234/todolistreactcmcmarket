## Overview

This Todo App is a feature-rich solution designed to streamline task management. It leverages React and Redux for a robust user interface, while Styled Components provide a visually appealing and responsive design.

## Components

### TodoApp

The main component serving as the entry point for the Todo App. Manages the overall application structure, including input for adding new todos and displaying the TodoList.

### TodoList

A component responsible for rendering the list of todos. It maps through the todos array and renders individual TodoItem components.

### TodoItem

Represents an individual todo item. Displays the todo text, allows marking a todo as complete or undoing completion, and provides an option to delete the todo.

## Redux Integration

### TodoReducers

Contains Redux reducers for handling todo-related actions. Manages the state for adding, completing, and deleting todos.

### TodoActions

Defines action creators for todo-related actions. These actions are dispatched to update the Redux state managed by TodoReducers.

### ConfigureStore

Configures the Redux store for the application. Combines reducers and exports types for RootState and AppDispatch.

## Solution Design

The Todo App follows a modular and scalable design pattern. Components are organized for reusability, and Redux is used for centralized state management. The application is designed with best practices for maintainability and performance.

## Todo Types

Defines TypeScript interfaces for the Todo object and TodosState, ensuring type safety throughout the application.

## React Testing

Test cases are written using React Testing Library to ensure the functionality and correctness of each component, reducer, and action. The testing suite covers a comprehensive range of scenarios to guarantee a robust application.

## Styled Components

Styled Components are employed for consistent and visually appealing styling. The design is responsive, adapting to various screen sizes, and adheres to modern design principles.

## Provider and Store (index.tsx)

The `index.tsx` file sets up the Redux Provider and integrates the Redux store with the React application, ensuring global state management.

## App.tsx

The main application file where the Todo App component is rendered. This file serves as the entry point for the React application.
